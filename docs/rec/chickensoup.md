* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 carrots, peeled and sliced
* 2 celery stalks, sliced
* 6 cups chicken broth (store-bought or homemade)

Pour in the chicken broth. Add salt, pepper, thyme, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil.

Reduce heat to a simmer. Stir in the cooked chicken. Let it simmer gently for about 20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
