## Garlic Chicken

Servings: 2–4  
Prep Time: 10 minutes  
Cook Time: 20 minutes  
Total Time: 30 minutes  

**Ingredients:**
* 2 tablespoons olive oil or butter
* 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or thighs)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 6–8 garlic cloves, minced or thinly sliced
* ½ teaspoon paprika (optional)
* ¼ cup chicken broth (or water)
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)
* Chopped parsley for garnish (optional)

**Instructions:**
1. Prepare the chicken:
Pat chicken dry and season both sides with salt, pepper, and paprika if using.

2. Sear the chicken:
Heat olive oil or butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook 5–6 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove and set aside.

3. Cook the garlic:
In the same pan, lower the heat slightly. Add the garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, until fragrant—don’t let it burn.

4. Deglaze and make sauce:
Add chicken broth and stir, scraping up any bits from the bottom. Simmer for 1–2 minutes. Stir in lemon juice if using.

5. Return chicken to the pan:
Add the chicken back to the pan and spoon the garlic sauce over it. Simmer for another 2 minutes so the flavors soak in.

6. Garnish and serve:
Sprinkle with fresh parsley if desired and serve hot.
