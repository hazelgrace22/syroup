**Ingredients:**
* 1 tablespoon oil or butter
* 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (or boneless if preferred)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 small onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 cup long-grain white rice (uncooked)
* 2 ¼ cups chicken broth
* ½ teaspoon dried thyme or oregano (optional)
* 1 cup frozen peas or chopped vegetables (optional)
* Chopped parsley or green onions for garnish (optional)

**Instructions:**
1. Season the chicken:
Pat the chicken dry and season both sides with salt and pepper.

2. Brown the chicken:
In a large skillet or pot with a lid, heat oil over medium heat. Add chicken, skin-side down, and cook until browned (about 4–5 minutes per side). Remove and set aside.

3. Sauté the aromatics:
In the same pan, add chopped onion and garlic. Cook for 2–3 minutes until softened.

4. Add rice and broth:
Stir in the rice and toast for 1 minute. Pour in the chicken broth and add thyme if using. Bring to a gentle boil.

5. Return chicken to the pan:
Place the browned chicken on top of the rice. Reduce heat to low, cover with a lid, and simmer for 25–30 minutes, or until the rice is tender and chicken is fully cooked.

6. Add veggies (optional):
If using peas or vegetables, stir them in during the last 5 minutes of cooking.

7. Garnish and serve:
Remove from heat and let it sit for 5 minutes. Garnish with parsley or green onions before serving.
