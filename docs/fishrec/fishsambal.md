## Fish Sambal

Servings: 2–4  
Prep Time: 10 minutes  
Cook Time: 20 minutes  
Total Time: 30 minutes  

**Ingredients:**
* 2–4 fish fillets (mackerel, snapper, tilapia, or any firm white fish)
* Salt and turmeric powder for seasoning
* 2 tablespoons oil  
  
For the Sambal Sauce:
* 5–6 dried red chilies (soaked in hot water for 10 mins) or 2–3 fresh red chilies (adjust to taste)
* 2 shallots or 1 small onion
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 teaspoon belacan (fermented shrimp paste) optional but authentic
* 1 small tomato (or 1 tbsp tomato paste)
* 1 tablespoon tamarind juice (or 1 tsp lime juice)
* 1 teaspoon sugar (to balance the heat)
* Salt to taste
* 2 tablespoons oil (for frying the sambal)

**Instructions:**
1. Season the fish:
Rub fish fillets with a pinch of salt and turmeric. Set aside for 5–10 minutes.

2. Prepare the sambal paste:
Blend soaked chilies, shallots/onion, garlic, tomato, and belacan into a smooth paste. Add a splash of water if needed.

3. Fry the fish:
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan over medium heat. Fry the fish on both sides until golden and cooked through (about 3–4 minutes per side). Remove and set aside.

4. Cook the sambal:
In the same pan, add a bit more oil if needed. Fry the sambal paste over medium heat, stirring often, until the oil separates and the paste is fragrant (about 5–7 minutes).

5. Season the sambal:
Stir in tamarind juice, sugar, and salt. Taste and adjust—sambal should be spicy, tangy, and slightly sweet.

6. Combine and serve:
Return the fried fish to the pan, spoon the sambal over the top, and let it simmer together for 2–3 minutes.
