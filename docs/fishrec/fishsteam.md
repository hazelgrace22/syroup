## Steamed Fish with Soy Sauce

Servings: 2–4  
Prep Time: 10 minutes  
Cook Time: 10–12 minutes  
Total Time: 20–25 minutes  

**Ingredients:**
* 1 whole fish (like sea bass, tilapia, or snapper), cleaned and scaled
or 2–3 fish fillets (firm white fish like cod or grouper)
* 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry / water)
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 thumb-size piece of ginger, julienned
* 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* 2–3 stalks green onions, julienned
* Fresh cilantro (optional, for garnish)
* 1 small red chili, thinly sliced (optional, for color and spice)

**Instructions:**
1. Prepare the fish:
Rinse and pat dry. Make a few diagonal cuts on both sides of the fish (if whole) to help it cook evenly. Place on a heatproof plate that fits into your steamer.

2. Top with aromatics:
Scatter half the ginger and garlic over the fish. Reserve the rest for later.

3. Steam the fish:
Bring water in your steamer to a boil. Place the fish plate in the steamer and cover. Steam for about 8–10 minutes (fillets) or 12–15 minutes (whole fish), depending on thickness, until fish is just cooked and flakes easily.

4. Make the soy sauce mixture:
In a small saucepan, heat soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, and a teaspoon of water over low heat. Do not boil — just warm it up.

5. Heat oil and aromatics:
In another small pan, heat sesame oil and remaining garlic and ginger until sizzling. Remove from heat.

6. Assemble and serve:
Once the fish is done, pour the warmed soy sauce mixture over it. Then drizzle the hot sesame oil with the crispy garlic and ginger on top. Garnish with green onions, chili slices, and cilantro if using.
